Read large files, line by line, without causing memory overflow for **[Laravel](https://laravel.com/docs)** applications.

This package, for **[Laravel](https://laravel.com/docs)** applications, allows you to read the contents of huge files without killing your server, that is, without having to load all the contents at once in memory causing an ***out-of-memory errors***.

The strategy used here, thanks to php's **[SplFileObject](https://www.php.net/manual/en/class.splfileobject.php)**, is to read the contents of the file line by line optimizing the use of server resources and, most importantly, in an efficient way.

It is also possible to paginate the contents of the file, again, without having to load it entirely into memory thanks to php's **[LimitIterator](https://www.php.net/manual/en/class.limititerator.php)**.

```php
use FruiVita\LineReader\Facades\LineReader;

$generator = LineReader::readLines($file_path);

// or

$length_aware_paginator = LineReader::readPaginatedLines($file_path, $per_page, $page);
```

## Notes

‚≠ê Internally, this package reads the file contents using php's **[SplFileObject](https://www.php.net/manual/en/class.splfileobject.php)** class. In the specific case of pagination, the **[LimitIterator](https://www.php.net/manual/en/class.limititerator.php)** is used to delimit the beginning and end of the content to be read.

‚ù§Ô∏è Heavily inspired by the [bcremer/LineReader](https://github.com/bcremer/LineReader) package.

## Prerequisites

1. PHP dependencies

    PHP ^8.0

    [Extensions](https://getcomposer.org/doc/03-cli.md#check-platform-reqs)

    ```bash
    composer check-platform-reqs
    ```

2. [GitHub Package Dependencies](/../../network/dependencies)

‚¨ÜÔ∏è [Back](#table-of-contents)

&nbsp;

## Installation

1. Install via **[composer](https://getcomposer.org/)**:

    ```bash
    composer require fruivita/line-reader
    ```

2. Optionally publish the translations

    ```bash
    php artisan vendor:publish --provider='FruiVita\LineReader\LineReaderServiceProvider' --tag='lang'
    ```

    The strings available for translation are as follows. Change them as needed.

    ```json
    {
        "The file entered could not be read": "The file entered could not be read"
    }
    ```

    >This package already has translations for **en** and **pt-br**.

## How it works

1. Reading a file line by line.

    ```php
    use FruiVita\LineReader\Facades\LineReader;

    public function example()
    {
        foreach (LineReader::readLines($file_path) as $line_number => $line_content)
        {
            // $line_number is 1 when reading the 1st line, 2 when reading the 2nd line, and so on.
            // $line_content string with the contents of the line.
        }
    }
    ```

    &nbsp;

    LineReader exposes the following method to read the file line by line:

    ‚úèÔ∏è **readLines**

    ```php
    use FruiVita\LineReader\Facades\LineReader;

    /**
     * @param string $file_path full path of the file to be read
     * 
     * @throws \FruiVita\LineReader\Exceptions\FileNotReadableException
     *
     * @return \Generator
     */
    LineReader::readLines(string $file_path);
    ```

    &nbsp;

    üö® **Exceptions**:

    - **readLines** throws **\FruiVita\LineReader\Exceptions\FileNotReadableException** if don't have read permission on the file or it can't be found

    &nbsp;

2. Reading the file by page.

    ```php
    use FruiVita\LineReader\Facades\LineReader;

    public function example()
    {
        $per_page = 15;
        $page = 2;

        $length_aware_paginator = LineReader::readPaginatedLines(string $file_path, int $per_page, int $page);
        
        // The index of the items in the collection respects their position in the file, that is, in the example
        // above the 1st item on page 2 will have index 16, since it is the 16th line of the file and the last
        // item on page 2 will have index 30, since it is the 30th line of the file.
    }
    ```

    &nbsp;

    LineReader exposes the following method to read the file by page:

    ‚úèÔ∏è **readPaginatedLines**

    ```php
    use FruiVita\LineReader\Facades\LineReader;

    /**
     * @param string $file_path full path of the file to be read
     * @param int    $per_page
     * @param int    $page
     * @param string $page_name
     *
     * @throws \FruiVita\LineReader\Exceptions\FileNotReadableException
     * @throws \InvalidArgumentException
     * 
     * @return \Illuminate\Pagination\LengthAwarePaginator
     */
    LineReader::readPaginatedLines(string $file_path, int $per_page, int $page, string $page_name = 'page');
    ```

    &nbsp;

    üö® **Exceptions**:

    - **readPaginatedLines** throws **\FruiVita\LineReader\Exceptions\FileNotReadableException** if don't have read permission on the file or it can't be found
    - **readPaginatedLines** throws **\InvalidArgumentException** if per_page or page is less than 1
